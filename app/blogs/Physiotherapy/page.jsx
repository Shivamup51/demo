        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The Importance of Physiotherapy: The Role of Physiotherapy in Today’s Life</h1>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          In today’s fast-moving, stress-laden lifestyle, our bodies often bear the brunt of inactivity, poor posture, injury, 
          and age-related conditions. Amid these growing challenges, physiotherapy stands as a powerful, science-backed solution 
          to restore movement, manage pain, and maintain holistic wellness.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Physiotherapy is no longer just a tool for post-injury rehabilitation. Its scope has evolved to encompass preventive 
          care, mobility enhancement, and support for chronic conditions—making it vital for all age groups, from young athletes 
          to aging adults. At its core, physiotherapy promotes healing through movement, ensuring that the body functions at its 
          optimal capacity without reliance on medication or invasive procedures.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Beyond Injuries: A Holistic Approach to Health</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Many people associate physiotherapy with recovery from accidents or surgeries. However, its benefits stretch far beyond 
          that. Whether you’re battling back pain from extended desk hours, recovering from childbirth, or experiencing stiffness 
          due to arthritis, physiotherapy offers targeted techniques to alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Techniques such as dry needling, manual therapy, laser therapy, cupping, and kinesio taping are designed to stimulate 
          blood flow, reduce inflammation, and enhance muscle function. These tools work not only to treat conditions but to 
          prevent them before they impair your daily functioning.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Improving Daily Performance</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Everyday activities—walking, climbing stairs, working at a desk—require coordinated movement and joint stability. Poor 
          ergonomics or sedentary habits often lead to muscular imbalances and postural dysfunctions. Physiotherapy intervenes 
          early by evaluating these patterns and prescribing corrective exercises and therapies that bring your body back into 
          alignment.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          For professionals juggling long hours, physiotherapy helps prevent strain-related issues like frozen shoulder or 
          repetitive stress injuries. For seniors, it supports balance and joint mobility, reducing fall risk. And for young 
          adults or athletes, it enhances performance while reducing injury susceptibility.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">A Personalized Path to Wellness</h2>
