        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Pain Management: Healing Through Movement, Not Medication</h1>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Pain can be debilitating—affecting mobility, mood, work, and quality of life. Whether it’s chronic backaches, 
          post-surgical discomfort, or acute sports injuries, the path to recovery often feels overwhelming. But effective 
          pain management isn’t about numbing symptoms—it’s about addressing the source.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, pain is treated not as a standalone issue but as a 
          window into deeper biomechanical imbalances. Our goal is to empower patients with long-lasting, drug-free relief 
          rooted in clinical physiotherapy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Understanding Pain: Beyond the Surface</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Pain signals that something in your body is not working properly. However, traditional approaches often focus on 
          temporary relief through medication, ignoring the underlying cause. Physiotherapy offers a more sustainable and 
          diagnostic method—using posture assessments, strength tests, and movement analysis to understand why pain exists.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa, every patient begins with a thorough consultation to map out lifestyle, injury history, muscle dynamics, 
          and joint mobility. Whether it’s nerve compression from poor sitting posture or inflammation from repetitive strain, 
          our therapists go beyond the obvious to locate the true trigger.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Therapeutic Tools That Work</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After identifying the root cause, we provide personalized treatment. Kynexa’s therapists apply a combination of 
          hands-on techniques and modern modalities including:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Manual Therapy:</span> Targeted joint mobilization to reduce stiffness and improve flexibility</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Dry Needling:</span> Stimulates tissue repair and alleviates muscular tightness</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Laser Therapy:</span> Accelerates healing and reduces inflammation</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Kinesio Taping:</span> Provides support to muscles and joints and facilitates enhanced circulation</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Cupping Therapy:</span> Enhances blood flow and eases muscle tension</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          For every case—whether it’s sciatica, tendonitis, fibromyalgia, or frozen shoulder—we create customized 
          rehabilitation plans aimed at restoring function while reducing pain intensity.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Role of Corrective Exercises</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Therapy sessions at Kynexa don’t end at the treatment table. Patients receive exercise-based rehabilitation that 
          focuses on strengthening weak areas, retraining movement patterns, and preventing relapse. These might include core 
          stabilization, stretching, resistance drills, or proprioception work depending on the diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          What makes these routines different? They’re based on your body’s biomechanical map—not generic templates. Our goal 
          is not just to reduce pain, but to build resilience against it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Home-Based Physiotherapy: Care That Comes to You</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Pain management shouldn’t rely on your commute. For patients with limited mobility or time constraints, Kynexa’s 
          home visit services deliver quality care right to your doorstep. Therapists bring portable equipment and tailor 
          programs for in-home recovery—ensuring that even remote patients receive consistent, professional support.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          These visits also allow us to assess real-world triggers: your mattress, work desk, or walking surfaces—offering 
          ergonomic adjustments that support long-term recovery.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Healing Mind and Body</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Chronic pain also takes a toll emotionally, leading to frustration and even anxiety. At Kynexa, we prioritize mental 
          well-being alongside physical recovery. Our therapists build trust through gentle guidance, constant communication, 
          and motivational support.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Progress is tracked not only by reduced discomfort but by improved sleep, better concentration, and increased 
          confidence in movement.
        </p>
