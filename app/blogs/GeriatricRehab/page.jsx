        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Geriatric Rehabilitation: Reclaiming Strength, Confidence, and Independence in Aging</h1>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Growing older is inevitable—but it doesn’t have to come at the cost of your strength, freedom, or zest for life. 
          With the right care, older adults can enjoy mobility, manage pain, and maintain an active lifestyle well into their 
          golden years. Geriatric rehabilitation plays a critical role in this journey, offering therapeutic support tailored 
          to age-related physical changes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, we specialize in helping seniors regain strength, 
          improve balance, and live with dignity. Our approach is holistic, compassionate, and rooted in evidence-based 
          physiotherapy designed around each patient’s functional goals.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">The Unique Needs of Aging Bodies</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With age, the body undergoes natural wear and tear—bones become less dense, muscles weaken, and joints lose their 
          range of motion. These changes increase the risk of falls, fractures, and mobility limitations. Conditions like 
          arthritis, osteoporosis, Parkinson’s disease, and post-stroke impairments often compound these challenges.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Geriatric rehabilitation at Kynexa doesn’t treat symptoms in isolation. We dive deep into understanding how multiple 
          systems interact—from muscular coordination to neurological function—and create personalized recovery plans that 
          focus on restoring capability, not just reducing pain.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Restoring Mobility, One Step at a Time</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Movement is central to independence. Our therapists begin with thorough assessments—evaluating balance, gait, 
          strength, and posture—to identify areas of risk or discomfort. Then, they craft tailored programs that include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-base">
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Balance and Fall Prevention Training</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Joint Mobilization and Flexibility Work</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Strength Conditioning for Muscles and Bones</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Post-surgical Rehabilitation (hip/knee replacements)</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Pain Management with Laser and Manual Therapy</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Neuromuscular Re-education for Stroke or Parkinson’s Patients</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Sessions focus not only on physical improvement but also on building the confidence necessary to navigate stairs, 
          bathe independently, or simply enjoy a walk in the park without fear.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Empathy, Patience, and Clinical Precision</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Older adults often require slower paced, highly supportive care environments. Kynexa’s clinicians bring not just 
          clinical excellence but deep empathy to each session. Every program is adjusted for comfort, fatigue levels, and 
          emotional well-being—because geriatric care is as much about listening as it is about treating.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          We also integrate tools like kinesio taping, cupping therapy, and electrostimulation where needed, ensuring maximum 
          therapeutic benefit while keeping sessions engaging and safe.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Home-Based Rehabilitation Options</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Understanding the mobility limitations some seniors face, Kynexa offers home visit physiotherapy services. This 
          ensures continuity of care and eliminates the challenge of traveling to the clinic—while still delivering the same 
          level of personalized attention and structured progress tracking.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Home sessions also involve family education, so caregivers understand how to support recovery between visits through 
          correct lifting techniques, posture cues, and environment modifications.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Because Aging Shouldn’t Limit Living</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Geriatric rehabilitation is not about reversing aging—it’s about embracing it with strength and grace. With the 
          right care, seniors can recover from injuries, reduce dependency, and continue to participate in life’s moments.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, we treat every elderly client with respect, focus, and 
          individualized attention. We make rehabilitation a journey of empowerment, not just a response to decline.
        </p>
