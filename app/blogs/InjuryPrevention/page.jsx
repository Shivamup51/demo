        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Injury Prevention and Treatment: Restoring Strength Before It Breaks</h1>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
          Injuries can strike anyone—whether you’re an athlete, a corporate professional, or someone just going about daily 
          life. A sprained ankle during a morning jog, shoulder pain from hours at a desk, or lingering soreness after lifting 
          groceries—each stem from the same underlying issue: insufficient preventive care.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, injury prevention and treatment aren’t reactive 
          protocols—they’re proactive partnerships. Our mission is to help patients build long-term resilience through guided 
          movement, clinical insight, and focused rehabilitation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Understanding Injury Before It Happens</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Most injuries don’t happen in isolation. They’re often the result of poor posture, muscle imbalances, repetitive 
          strain, or incorrect movement techniques. By identifying these underlying causes early, physiotherapists help you 
          avoid major setbacks altogether.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa, we begin with comprehensive biomechanical assessments to understand how your body moves, where it 
          compensates, and what might trigger discomfort. Whether you’re a runner, desk worker, or recovering from surgery, 
          our screening tools detect red flags like joint instability, tightness, and muscular inefficiencies that predispose 
          you to injury.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Smart Prevention, Not Just Strong Muscles</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Strength alone isn’t enough—effective injury prevention includes flexibility, coordination, balance, and endurance. 
          That’s why Kynexa’s plans incorporate functional training: exercises designed to mimic real-world movements while 
          correcting posture and building joint support.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether it’s a knee stabilization routine for a weekend footballer or ergonomic strategies for corporate employees, 
          our therapists integrate simple but targeted routines into your lifestyle. These might include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Core strengthening:</span> to support lower back health</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Shoulder mobility drills:</span> for overhead movement</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Ankle stability work:</span> to reduce sprain risk</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Stretch sequences:</span> for tight hamstrings and hip flexors</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          And we make it sustainable—because consistency beats intensity when it comes to injury-free living.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Treatment that Goes Beyond Recovery</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Once an injury occurs, the goal isn’t just to heal—it’s to recover fully, without fear of recurrence. That means 
          moving past temporary fixes and addressing the mechanics of the injury.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Kynexa’s treatment plans blend manual therapy, dry needling, laser therapy, and taping techniques to reduce 
          inflammation and activate tissue healing. More importantly, our sessions involve patient education—so you understand 
          your own recovery and learn how to protect vulnerable areas in the future.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          For chronic conditions like tennis elbow, runner’s knee, or frozen shoulder, we chart progress not just by pain 
          reduction but by restored movement, improved strength, and return to daily function. Our clinic also offers home 
          visit programs, making expert therapy accessible for those with limited mobility or packed schedules.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Collaboration That Heals</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Healing isn’t just clinical—it’s collaborative. At Kynexa, our team builds real relationships with our patients. We 
          listen to your concerns, adjust plans when needed, and stay invested until you regain confidence in your movement.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Whether you need post-surgical rehab, sports recovery, or preventive guidance, our therapists create tailored 
          programs that reflect your body’s needs, and your lifestyle demands.
        </p>
