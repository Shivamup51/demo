        <p className="mb-6">
          In today’s hectic world, exercise is more than just a trend—it’s a necessity. But fitness isn’t one-size-fits-all, 
          and poorly structured workouts often lead to burnout or injury. That’s where physiotherapy-guided exercise makes a 
          difference. With clinical insight and personalized planning, exercise becomes not just safer—but more purposeful.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, we help clients move smarter. Our therapists blend 
          rehabilitation science with strength training principles, creating programs that build endurance, enhance flexibility, 
          and protect against injuries—without compromising health.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Why Physiotherapy-Based Fitness Works</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Unlike generic gym routines, physiotherapy-led fitness addresses individual biomechanics, medical history, and 
          functional goals. Whether you’re recovering from injury, managing chronic pain, or simply starting your wellness 
          journey, structured movement ensures your efforts are both safe and effective.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our team at Kynexa designs programs using:

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Preventing Injuries Before They Happen</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Improper form, overtraining, and ignoring warning signs are common causes of fitness injuries. At Kynexa, 
          prevention is woven into every workout. Our therapists analyze gait, posture, and muscular coordination to 
          identify potential risks—then craft exercise routines that strengthen vulnerable areas.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Whether you’re a weekend runner looking to avoid shin splints, a yoga enthusiast dealing with wrist strain, 
          or a beginner unsure where to start, we’ll guide you to injury-free movement and optimal recovery.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Exercise for Chronic Pain and Rehabilitation</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">

        <p className="mb-6">
          Exercise isn’t just physical—it’s emotional. Consistent, guided movement improves sleep, uplifts mood, boosts 
          energy, and builds self-esteem. At Kynexa, we celebrate progress in every form, whether it’s climbing stairs 
          with ease or managing stress with mindful movement.
