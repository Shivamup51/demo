        <p className="mb-6">
          The pelvic floor comprises a complex network of muscles that provide essential support to the bladder, bowel, 
          reproductive organs, and contribute significantly to core stability. Although the pelvic floor plays a vital role in 
          maintaining physical health, it often remains insufficiently recognized and inadequately studied. Weakness, imbalance, 
          or dysfunction in these muscles can lead to incontinence, sexual dysfunction, lower back pain, and a compromised 
          quality of life.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Kynexa Advanced Physiotherapy and Manual Therapy Clinic, we champion a discreet, personalized, and effective 
          approach to pelvic health. Whether you’re recovering postnatally, managing post-prostate surgery symptoms, or seeking 
          preventive care, our team offers expert physiotherapy that restores control, function, and confidence.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Understanding the Pelvic Floor: Beyond Gender Boundaries</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Though pelvic floor concerns are often associated with women, men experience their own challenges related to this 
          crucial region. For both sexes, the pelvic floor plays a central role in urinary control, core stabilization, and 
          sexual function.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li className="mb-2">
            For Women, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and hormonal fluctuations can strain the pelvic floor muscles. Common 
            conditions include pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, menstrual-related pain, and postpartum instability.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            In males, the pelvic floor plays a critical role in supporting bowel and bladder function and is closely associated 
            with prostate health. Dysfunction may lead to erectile challenges, post-surgical complications, and urinary leakage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Kynexa’s therapists recognize these gender-specific concerns and offer dedicated programs designed to reflect 
          individual anatomy, history, and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Symptoms That Call for Attention</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Pelvic floor dysfunction presents with varying manifestations in males and females. Some common red flags include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Urinary urgency or leakage</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Pain during intercourse</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Difficulty with bowel movements</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Feeling of heaviness or pressure in the pelvis</span></li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Lower abdominal or back pain without a clear cause</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Ignoring these symptoms can worsen the issue. But with early intervention, most conditions improve significantly—and 
          in many cases, resolve completely.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Clinical Care with Compassion</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Kynexa’s pelvic health program is built on trust, privacy, and clinical precision. We start with a comprehensive 
          assessment—including postural evaluation, core function testing, and muscle palpation. Based on this, your therapist 
          designs a tailored plan combining:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 text-gray-700">
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Pelvic Floor Exercises:</span> (including Kegels and breathing integration)</li>
          <li className="mb-2"><span className='font-bold'>Biofeedback Training:</span> for muscle awareness and control</li>

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Therapists explain every step, respect boundaries, and ensure comfort throughout sessions. For those who prefer care 
          in the privacy of their own homes, Kynexa offers home-based pelvic physiotherapy visits as well.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900">Why Choose Physiotherapy Over Other Options?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Unlike medication or surgery, physiotherapy treats the cause of pelvic dysfunction—not just the symptoms. It’s 
          non-invasive, empowering, and rooted in movement science. The goal isn’t just recovery—it’s prevention and long-term 
          resilience.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Clients often report improved sleep, better intimacy, restored bladder control, and a renewed sense of confidence 
          after completing their physiotherapy cycles with Kynexa.
        </p>
